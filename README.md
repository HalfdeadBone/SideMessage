# SideMessage
Quick messenging app :D for now in python.


## Side Story
I am fed up with multiples of choices in message apps. I want just to: Get the response, and send a response. 
You know - i am normaly chating on signal, reddit, facebook, cause i want to stay in touch. But you know what ist anoying? 
Every Fucking app need to much resources (f u garbege "meta") or just you need to have multiple tabs in a browser. So. How can we change that?
I dont want to use Browser to open them i dont want to fight with it - all i want is fast response, one app. For now just api.
