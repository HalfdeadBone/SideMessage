# SideMessage
Quick messenging app :D for now in python.


## Side Story
I am fed up with multiples of choices in message apps. I want just to:
- Get the response ...  
- ... and send a response. 

I am normaly chating on signal, reddit, facebook cause i want to stay in touch, but you know what is anoying? 
Every Fucking app need to much resources (f u garbege "meta") or just you need to have multiple apss opem or tabs in a browser. So... How can we change that?
I dont want to use Browser to open them i dont want to fight with it - all i want is fast response, one app. For now just api.

## ToDo
- [ ] Message storage (signal like)
- [ ] Twitter recive message
- [ ] Twitter send message
- [ ] Signal Recive Message
- [ ] Signal send message
- [ ] Discord recive message
- [ ] Discord Send message

Ideas 
- [ ] grouping people (1 setting 1 person x acc)

Broken
- [x] reddit messages (only inbox available)
- [x] Messenger Bullshit - WHO DA FUQ DECIDED THAT REMOVING READING PERSONAL MESSAGES IS A GOOD IDEA... WHO? To access that i need to have "business". Now no wonder that there is no optimised alternatives for messenger apps, at least for free... Thanks wanna be meta/facebook... No wonder why it was called the worst api... Ugh.
